The primary entry point for the E-Commerce Microservice Platform, responsible for routing external HTTP traffic to internal gRPC services.

## üìñ Overview

This service acts as a reverse proxy, security checkpoint, and orchestration layer for the entire platform. Its core responsibilities include:

*   **Protocol Translation:** Translating incoming public HTTP/REST requests into specific, internal gRPC calls.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Verifying JWTs for protected routes and enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access (e.g., Admin-only endpoints).
*   **Single Point of Entry:** Providing a unified and consistent API surface for all external clients, hiding the complexity of the internal microservice architecture.
*   **Centralized Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Handling observability (metrics, initial traces) and security at the edge of the system.

## üöÄ Architecture

The API Gateway sits between the end-user and the internal microservice network. It uses a middleware chain to process requests before they are routed to the appropriate backend service.

    U[üë§ User] -- HTTP/REST --> GW[üåê API Gateway];

    subgraph "Internal gRPC Network"
        GW -- gRPC --> US[üßë‚Äçüíº User Service];

        GW -- gRPC --> OS[üì¨ Order Service];
    end

      GW -- Traces --> JAEGER[(üîç Jaeger)];
      GW -- Metrics --> PROM[(üìä Prometheus)];
      GW -- Logs --> EFK[(üìù EFK Stack)];
    end
```

A typical request flows through the following middleware layers within the gateway:
1.  **Observability Middleware (`otelfiber`, `fiberprometheus`):** Creates the root span for distributed tracing and records metrics for the request.
2.  **Security Middleware:** Checks for a valid JWT and verifies user roles for protected endpoints.
3.  **Request Handler:** Forwards the request to the corresponding internal service via a gRPC client call.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

This service is designed to be run as part of the complete platform using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   All project repositories must be cloned at the same directory level.

### Running

The service is automatically built and started when you run the main `docker-compose up` command from the `docker-compose-environment` repository.

For detailed instructions, please see the [main project README](https://github.com/ogozo/docker-compose-environment/blob/main/README.md).

### Environment Variables

The gateway is configured via the `env/gateway.env` file in the main compose directory.

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HTTP_PORT` | The port on which the HTTP server listens. | `:3000` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`| Secret key for signing and verifying JWTs. | `super-secret-key` |
| `USER_SERVICE_URL`| Address of the User gRPC service. | `service-user:50051` |
| `PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL`| Address of the Product gRPC service. | `service-product:50052` |
| `CART_SERVICE_URL` | Address of the Cart gRPC service. | `service-cart:50053` |
| `ORDER_SERVICE_URL` | Address of the Order gRPC service. | `service-order:50054` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`| Service name for observability. | `api-gateway` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`| OTLP endpoint for Jaeger. | `jaeger-tracer:4317` |
